# Auto

Auto is a desktop app that runs on any operating system and provides a simple way to automate both clicking and typing.

### A note about the development of Auto v2

I started working on Auto v2 immediately after finishing the first version. I had a lot of ideas about how I could improve the program and was excited to work on it. Unfortunately, about a week in, my laptop's keyboard broke :( the ctrl/z/x/c/v keys all stopped working and I was unable to get a new one because of my financial situation. This led to me spending less and less time programming and by the end of the month, I simply quit because it was too frustrating to be limited by my tools. About 12 months later, I got a new keyboard and started working on the project again but I decided to put it on hold because I was significantly worse at programming. Below is an image of a prototype user-interface for auto v2. I intend to come back and work on it some more in the future but I do not know when. I am currently not sure whether I will do the second version in C++ or Java (this will affect cross-platform viability); when I decide, I plan to re-write the entire program from scratch again and implement some cool new programming techniques I learned!
